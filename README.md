## Reasoning
Since the taxonomy for categories can be arbitrarily deep, I chose a non-recursive approach that classifies each category as insertable or awaiting its parent's insertion and updates these running lists at every step of the iteration so that as soon as a parent is inserted, all the children that were waiting get inserted as well.
