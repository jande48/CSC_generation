## Reasoning
Since this data is hierarchical, my approach is to create a hash array to group data with the same parents, then write a recursive function to push child data only after its parents have been added.

I chose this method, because even though the initial JSON data may have 10,000+ objects, my assumption is that the number of categories (parent-child relationships), could be
much, much less and therefore reduce the recursive calls.
